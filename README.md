# About
Face mask and Social distancing monitoring and Automated reporting propose an efficient computer vision-based approach focused on the real-time 
automated monitoring of people to detect both safe social distancing and face masks in public 
places by implementing the model on computer to monitor activity and detect violations
through camera(webcam/Phone) or a Network connected device. After detection of breach,
computer sends an alert message including real-time Photograph of the individual violating
Covid Protocols to a Telegram Private Group made for this very cause.
